## üí° What‚Äôs This Repo?

This repository contains all my learning progress as I work through the 100 Days of Python challenge.  
Each file documents daily practice, concepts, and mini-projects I've built to strengthen my Python skills.

> Some files span multiple days (e.g., `day5-8.py`) when the topics were shorter or combined.

## üìò Topics Covered So Far:
- Variables & Data Types
- Loops & Conditionals
- Functions & Scope
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries
- File Handling
- String Manipulation
- And more...

## üöÄ Why I‚Äôm Doing This

My goal is to build a solid Python foundation before diving deeper into fields like:
- Artificial Intelligence ü§ñ
- Machine Learning üìä
- Cybersecurity üîê

This repo is a reflection of consistent learning ‚Äî and I‚Äôm building it publicly to stay accountable and grow.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

All files are stored in the main directory and named based on the day:
- `day1.py`
- `day2.py`
- `day5-8.py`
- etc.
