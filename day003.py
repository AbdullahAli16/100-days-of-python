# Day: 03(Pip and modules)

'''PIP is the package installer for Python. It allows you to easily install and manage external
modulesâ€”which are pre-written Python code files that add specific functionality, like working with
data, making web requests, or building interfaces. You can install modules using commands like pip
install module_name.'''
