# Day: 56(Intoduction to Object Oriented Programming)

"""By far what we were doing is referred to as procedural programming, and from here onward we will learn
object oriented programming. Let's talk about classes and objects.

Classes are basically a blueprint or template for creating objects of a specific kind.

For example: If we want to make to create enemies of a player in a game, so instead
of decalring every enemy object separately and assigning it the same attributes, 
properties and methods we declare a class of enemy in which we assign all the attributes
it will have, for a single time and after that we can just create objects of the enemy class
and each object will possess all the properties, attributes and methods of the enemy class


Objects are the instances of a class and it contains its own data and methods.

For example: A class like person can have properties like name and age and methods like walk(), eat()
and each object of this person class can have its own values to properties like name="john" age=34
but the methods would remain the same throughout the objects"""
